#### Problem :point_down:
Given a string `s` consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from `s`.  
Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.  

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.  

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.  
#### Sample Input :point_down:
```
s = "babaab"
```
#### Sample Output :point_down:
```
2
```
#### Explanation :point_down:
```
"babaab" → "bbb" → "". 
```
Remove palindromic subsequence `"aaa"` then `"bbb"`.  
Recall that a string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.
